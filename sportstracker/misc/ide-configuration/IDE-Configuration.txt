IDE Configuration
=================

All SportsTracker developers should use the same coding style and format. The
main benefits of a consistent code format are:

* code is easier to read
* less problems when merging files
* code reviews contain just the feature changes, 
  not tons of custom formatting changes

Most IDE's provide tools to ensure a consistent code format. For SportsTracker
there is an Eclipse Formatter configuration (ST-Formatter.xml) and an Organize
Imports configuration (ST-Imports.importorder).
These configurations can be used in Eclipse and in IntelliJ IDEA.

Developers should configure their IDE's as described below and always format
their code changes by using the formatter and the imports organizer. Only the
modified source code parts needs to be formatted, not the whole files or 
packages.


IntelliJ IDEA configuration (version 2017.x):
---------------------------------------------

Project import:

- Import Project in launch screen (or File -> Open)
- Select the pom.xml file in the SportsTracker root directory
- Un/Select these options in the import dialog:
  ( ) Search for projects recursively
  (x) Import Maven projects automatically
  (x) Keep project files in: PROJECT_DIRECTORY/.idea
      (PROJECT_DIRECTORY is your project folder)
  (x) Create IntelliJ IDEA modules for aggregator projects
  (x) Create module groups for multi-module Maven projects
  -> keep all the other options as they are
  

Code Style configuration:

- File -> Settings:
  - Plugins: 
    - install plugin "Eclipse Code Formatter" (version 15.x) and restart IDEA
  - Eclipse Code Formatter:
    - (x) Use the Eclipse code formatter
	- Create a Project specific profile
    - Eclipse Java Formatter config file: 
      - select file "ST-Formatter.xml" 
    - Java Formatter Profile:
      - select "SportsTracker"
    - (x) Optimize imports
    - Import order:
       - (x) From file: 
         - select file ST-Imports.importorder
  - Editor -> Code Style -> Java -> Tab 'Imports':
    - Class count to use import with '*': 999
    - Names count to use static import with '*': 99
  - Editor -> Code Style -> XML:
    - Select Scheme 'Default' and apply these changes:
      - Tabs and Indents:
        - ( ) Use tab character
        - Tab Size: 4
        - Indent: 4
      - Other:
        - Wrap attributes: Do not wrap
        - (x) Align attributes
        
- Formatter must be used manually on the edited Java and FXML files 
 (Code -> Show Reformat File Dialog) with the selected options:
  (x) Only VCS changed text
  (x) Organize imports
- For FXML files make sure that there are no unused and wildcard imports
  (performance brake)


Eclipse configuration (version 4.4, recent versions untested):
--------------------------------------------------------------

Project import:

- open the project by "Import -> Existing Maven Projects"
- you need to select the project root directory with all child modules here


Code Style configuration:

  - General -> Workspace:
    - Text file encoding: UTF-8
  - General -> Editors - Text Editors:

  - Java -> Code Style -> Organize Imports: 
    - Import file "ST-Imports.importorder"
    - Number of imports needed for .*: 999
    - Number of static imports needed for .*: 999
  - Java -> Editor -> Save Actions: 
    - (x) Perform the selected actions on save
        (x) Format source code
           (x) Format edited lines
        (x) Organize imports
